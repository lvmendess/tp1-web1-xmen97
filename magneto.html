                <p class="text">Erik Magnus Lehnsherr is a holocaust survivor. Having witnessed his
                    parents' death by the hand of the Nazi regime and, later, being hunted himself
                    because of his mutant abilities, Erik concluded that humanity would never accept
                    mutants in their own society because, according to him, mutants are the next step in
                    human evolution and, as such, biologically superior to them.

                <p>He worked alongside Charles Xavier in a psychiatric hospital after the war and the two formed a
                    friendship. But the contrast between their opinions on the matter of mutant-human
                    coexistence was always on the way and when Charles founded the X-Men, the two drifted apart.
