                <h2>Jean Grey</h2>
                <p class="text">Jean's telepathic powers first manifested as a child, when she witnessed the death of her best 
                    friend Annie Richardson. Due to their similar telekinesis abilities, Jean Grey was found by Charles Xavier 
                    who offered her parents to help control her powers. At Xavier's Westchester mansion, he helped her learn to
                    control her mind-reading powers, as well as train her to use her mind to manipulate objects, becoming the
                    first X-Men.
