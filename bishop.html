                <p class="text">Bishop is a mutant tracker turned time traveler from the year 2055 where, due to an assassination
                    in the 90s, the world is now ruled by Sentinels and all of the X-Men are dead, except
                    Wolverine. Bishop is then sent to the past to stop the event that caused his future to
                    be that way and he meets the X-Men.  
                </br></p>
                <p class="text">Later, in season 4, he gets trapped in the 90's due to his time
                    traveling equipment being broken, so he joins the X-Men while he's unable to go back
                    to his time.
