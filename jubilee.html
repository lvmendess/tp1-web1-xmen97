                <h2>Jubilee</h2>
                <p class="text">A 13 year old Jubilee was found by the X-Men Storm, Rogue and Gambit when a 
                    Sentinel was sent to capture her at a shopping mall and she was rescued by the X-Men
                    and taken to their headquarters (Xavier's Westchester mansion) so they could protect
                    her, should another Sentinel try to capture her again.
                </br></p>
                <p class="text">However, she escaped and tried to return to her adoptive parents' home
                    when 2 other Sentinels appeared, doped her with a gas that knocked her unconscious
                    and took her to one of their manufacturing facilities. There, the X-Men rescued her once
                    again and she decided to leave her parents' home and join them.
