                <h2>Morph</h2>
                <p class="text">Morph was born with the ability to shapeshift, perfectly copying the appeareance
                    and abilities of other people, animals and even inanimate objects. When he joined the X-Men,
                    he rapidly bonded with Wolverine, with the latter even saying that Morph was the only one who
                    understood him.
                </br></p>
                <p class="text">During a mission gone awry, Morph was left behind and believed to be dead, but he
                    had actually survived and was captured by Mr. Sinister. Under captivity, Sinister implanted some
                    sort of chip in Morph's brain, making him feel hatred towards the X-Men and seek vengeance against
                    them, which benefited Sinister's plans to distract the group so he could capture Jean and Scott.
