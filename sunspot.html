                <h2>Roberto da Costa</h2>
                <p class="text">The heir to the fortune of Da Costa family, Roberto was afraid 
                    to tell his parents that he was a mutant. He was kidnapped by the Friends of Humanity 
                    but rescued by the X-Men, who took him to the X-Mansion.
                </br></p>
                <p class="text">Later in the show ('97), he and Jubilee are chased after by Bastion's sentinels until he reaches
                    his parents house, where they're having a party. Afraid of receiving backlash, his mom tells
                    him to surrender to the sentinels. He's able to escape with Jubilee and joins the X-Men. Altough,
                    he sides with Magneto at the end, still heartbroken that his mom chose to give him away to
                    sentinels instead of protecting him.
