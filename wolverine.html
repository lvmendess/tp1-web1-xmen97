                <h2>Wolverine</h2>
                <p class="text">Born in the 1800s, James Howlett has lived many lives due to his
                    healing factor power, which allows his body to adapt to anything. He fought
                    in many wars, mainly the American Civil War, World War 1 and 2, even getting to fight
                    alongside Captain America in the latter.
                </br></p>
                <p class="text">Around the 1960s, he was the subject of scientific tests that put the world's
                    most durable metal, Adamantium, in his body. Thanks to his healing factor, Logan was able to
                    adapt and survive the procedure. Shortly after regaining consciousness, he realized he now had
                    retractible metal claws in his hands and used them to escape the lab.
