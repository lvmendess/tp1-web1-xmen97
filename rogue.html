                <h2>Rogue</h2>
                <p class="text">When she was 13 years old, Anne Marie found out her mutant abilities when she, 
                    unintentionally, put her first boyfriend, Cody, into a coma after kissing him for the first
                    time. Because of this accident, her father yelled at her for being a mutant and she ran away
                    from her home. Alone and with nowhere to go, Anne went to a train station where she met what she
                    thought was a kind, blonde woman who adopted and trained her.
                </p>
                <p class="text">Under the orders of this woman, Rogue commited several crimes and, on one occasion,
                    permanently absorbed Ms. Marvel's (Carol Danvers) powers and memories, putting her into a coma as well.
                    Feeling confused as to why the woman made her do it, her new powers and Carol's memories, she left
                    her adoptive mother and found Charles Xavier, who introduced her to the X-Men and helped her deal
                    with her powers and trauma.
