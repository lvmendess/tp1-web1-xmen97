                <h2>Gambit</h2>
                <p class="text">Unlike most mutants - whose mutations stay dormant until they hit puberty -,
                    Remy was born with his unique black and red eyes. Somehow (it's never really explained) his brother,
                     Bobby, got into the Thieve's Guild and dragged Remy along.
                </p>
                <p class="text">Growing up in the guild, he learned their ways and became an expert at robbing people, escaping
                    handcuffs and breaking out of prison, as well as using his mutant powers to do so. Later, he met Bella
                    Donna of the Assassins' Guild and, both because of love and to unite the guilds, they got engaged.
                    However, feeling guilty of his crimes and tired of the evergoing feud between the guilds, 
                    he left everything to join the X-Men. 
                </p>
